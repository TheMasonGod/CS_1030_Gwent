    <p>Gwent is a card game from the popular fantasy video game Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
        The story of Witcher 3 follows Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter for hire who embarks on a perilous journey across war-torn lands to find his adopted daughter Ciri, who is being pursued by the deadly Wild Hunt. 
        In the first two Witcher games, the side games you could play were dice poker but has been changed in the Witcher 3 to Gwent.
        Gwent is a strategy game about dominating your opponent, surpassing them and destorying their troops. 
        The goal of Gwent is best two out of three and whoever has the highest points from cards wins that round.
